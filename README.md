## Dataset Overview
The data set has has a record of 120,230 orders, $70.87 Million sales and 109,000 units total quanity. There duplicate and blank cells found which i handled using power query, I create a new column(Sales) multiplying qty and amount column to get the total sales for each order, i removed some columns i didn't need such as: Index, New and Pendimg. I did the cleaning of the dataset using power query and did both analysis and visualization using PowerBi.
